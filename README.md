# üõí Retail Product Placement Optimizer

An end-to-end machine learning project to analyze retail transaction data, uncover customer segments, discover product affinities, and generate actionable in-store product placement strategies.

---

## üìå Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Optimize product placement and boost retail sales by:

- Segmenting customers using RFM + clustering
- Identifying product co-purchase patterns using the Apriori algorithm
- Recommending shelf placements for cross-sell opportunities
- Delivering business-ready insights and visualizations

**Dataset:**  
[Online Retail Dataset (UCI)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail)

## üí° Key Insights

- **Best customers** spend frequently and recently (Cluster 2)
- **Nearly 50% of revenue** comes from low-frequency buyers (Cluster 0)
- **High lift rules** reveal strong product bundling opportunities
- **Placement strategy** can significantly boost cross-selling
